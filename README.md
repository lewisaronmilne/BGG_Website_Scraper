# BGG_Website_Scraper
This is a few scripts to scrape the data from the collums of a pdf with the library of a board games cafe and *tries* to match the games within to the one's in boardgamegeek's database.

cafe_scraper.js expect to run inside the browser console when the library pdf is open. Open it and copy the code into the console and continue from there.

It is very tedious as the data that's being scraped is very messy and needs to be fixed manually.
